## Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

## Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort builds the final sorted array one item at a time, by repeatedly picking the next element and inserting it into its correct position.

## Selection Sort
Selection Sort divides the list into a sorted and unsorted part, repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and moving it to the end of the sorted part.
