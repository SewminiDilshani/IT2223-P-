## Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

## Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort builds the final sorted array one item at a time, by repeatedly picking the next element and inserting it into its correct position.

## Selection Sort
Selection Sort divides the list into a sorted and unsorted part, repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and moving it to the end of the sorted part.

## Quick Sort
Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that picks a pivot element and partitions the array around the pivot, recursively sorting the subarrays.

## Merge Sort
Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into halves, sorts them recursively, and then merges the sorted halves.
